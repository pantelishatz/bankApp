BankApp is a Java-based banking application designed to empower users with efficient account management capabilities. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting modularity.

## Key Features

- **Account Operations**: BankApp allows users to perform essential banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. Users can conveniently manage their accounts with ease.

- **Account Types**: The application supports both regular accounts and overdraft accounts. Users can choose the account type that suits their financial needs and access the corresponding features and benefits.

- **Transaction Logging**: BankApp provides a transaction logging mechanism to keep a record of all account activities. Every deposit, withdrawal, or balance inquiry is logged, ensuring transparency and providing an audit trail for future reference.

- **No Database Integration**: BankApp, in its current state, does not integrate with a database. This design choice simplifies the application and allows for easy setup and deployment.

- **Modularity and Scalability**: The application is built with modularity and scalability in mind. It offers a solid foundation for future enhancements and extensions, including the integration of a database for improved data management and persistence.
